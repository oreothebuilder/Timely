Project Roadmap: AI-Assisted NEP 2020 Timetable GeneratorThis document outlines a phased approach to developing, testing, and deploying the intelligent timetable generation system.Phase 1: Discovery and Planning (Weeks 1-3)Goal: To define the project's scope, requirements, and technical foundation.1.1. Requirement Gathering:Conduct detailed interviews with college administrators, timetable committee members, faculty, and students.Gather all existing documentation: course structures, credit systems, faculty workload policies, room specifications.Understand the specific constraints and rules for B.Ed., M.Ed., ITEP, and FYUP programs.1.2. Data Analysis & Modeling:Analyze sample data from previous semesters.Finalize the database schema to accommodate all entities (students, faculty, courses, rooms, constraints).1.3. Technology Stack Selection:Finalize choices for frontend, backend, database, and AI/ML libraries.1.4. Project Management Setup:Set up a project management tool (like Jira or Trello).Establish a version control repository (Git).Phase 2: Design and Prototyping (Weeks 4-7)Goal: To design the user experience and build a functional proof-of-concept.2.1. UX/UI Design:Create wireframes and mockups for the admin dashboard, data input forms, timetable view, and reporting interfaces.Design a user-friendly and intuitive workflow.2.2. Develop Core Prototype (Frontend):Build the initial web interface based on the designs (similar to the HTML file provided).Implement forms for adding/editing courses, faculty, and rooms.2.3. Develop Core Algorithm (Backend):Implement the initial version of the scheduling algorithm (e.g., a constraint satisfaction solver or a genetic algorithm).Focus on handling basic conflicts (faculty, room, and time clashes).Phase 3: Core Development (Weeks 8-16)Goal: To build the full-featured application.3.1. Backend Development:Build robust REST APIs for all data management (CRUD operations for all entities).Integrate the AI/ML scheduling engine with the backend.Implement user authentication and authorization (admin roles).3.2. Frontend Development:Connect the frontend interface to the backend APIs.Develop the dynamic timetable display with editing, drag-and-drop, and filtering capabilities.Build the scenario simulation interface.3.3. Feature Implementation:Develop student preference and elective choice input modules.Add modules for special schedules (teaching practice, internships).Implement the export-to-PDF/Excel functionality.Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance (Weeks 17-19)Goal: To ensure the system is robust, bug-free, and accurate.4.1. Unit & Integration Testing:Write and run tests for individual backend and frontend components.4.2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):Conduct a pilot run with the college's timetable committee using real data from an upcoming semester.Gather feedback on usability, accuracy of the generated timetable, and performance.4.3. Performance & Load Testing:Simulate high traffic and large datasets to ensure the system remains responsive.Phase 5: Deployment and Integration (Week 20)Goal: To launch the system and integrate it with existing college infrastructure.5.1. Deployment:Set up production server environments (Cloud-based like AWS, Azure, or on-premise).Deploy the backend and frontend applications.5.2. Data Migration:Import existing student, faculty, and curriculum data into the new system.5.3. Integration:Develop connectors to integrate with the existing Academic Management System (AMS) or ERP if required.Phase 6: Maintenance and Evolution (Ongoing)Goal: To support users, fix issues, and add new features.6.1. User Training & Support:Provide training sessions and documentation for administrators.6.2. Monitoring & Bug Fixes:Continuously monitor system performance and address any issues that arise.6.3. Feature Enhancements:Plan and develop new features based on user feedback and changing NEP guidelines.
