System Architecture & Technology StackThis document outlines the proposed technical architecture, technology stack, and database schema for the Timetable Generation System.1. System ArchitectureA modern, scalable three-tier architecture is recommended.Frontend (Client-Side):This is the user interface that runs in the web browser.It will be a Single Page Application (SPA) providing a rich, interactive experience for administrators.Responsibilities: Data entry forms, interactive timetable grids, visualizations, and user session management.Backend (Server-Side):This is the central brain of the application. It exposes a REST API for the frontend to communicate with.Responsibilities:API Layer: Handles HTTP requests, authentication, and data validation.Business Logic: Implements the core functionalities of the system.AI/ML Engine: Contains the core scheduling algorithm (the solver) that generates the timetable based on all constraints.Database Interaction: Manages all communication with the database.Database:A relational database is ideal for storing the structured and interconnected data of a timetable system.Responsibilities: Persistently store all information about courses, faculty, students, rooms, constraints, and generated timetables.2. Recommended Technology StackThis stack is based on popular, robust, and well-supported open-source technologies.Frontend:Framework: React.js or Vue.js (React is more popular with a larger ecosystem).UI Library: Material-UI (MUI) or Ant Design for pre-built, professional components.State Management: Redux Toolkit or Zustand.Styling: Tailwind CSS or Styled-Components.Backend:Language: Python (The standard for AI/ML).Framework: Django or Flask. (Django is "batteries-included" and great for rapid development with a built-in admin panel; Flask is more lightweight and flexible).API Standard: REST or GraphQL.AI/ML Engine (Python Libraries):Constraint Programming: Google OR-Tools (highly recommended), or python-constraint. This approach models the problem by defining variables, domains, and constraints, which is a natural fit for timetabling.Genetic Algorithms: DEAP or geneticalgorithm. This is another powerful approach that evolves solutions over generations to find an optimal one. It's excellent for complex optimization problems.Database:Relational Database: PostgreSQL (Recommended for its robustness, scalability, and advanced features). MySQL is also a solid choice.Deployment:Containerization: Docker (For packaging the application for consistent deployment).Cloud Provider: AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure for hosting.3. Basic Database SchemaThis is a simplified schema. You will need to expand it with more fields and relationships.Facultyfaculty_id (Primary Key)nameexpertise (e.g., Array of course_codes)availability (e.g., JSON object with day/time preferences/unavailability)max_workload_hoursCoursescourse_id (Primary Key)course_codecourse_namecreditstype ('Theory', 'Practical')program ('B.Ed', 'FYUP', etc.)semesterrequires_lab (Boolean)Students / StudentGroupsgroup_id (Primary Key) (It's more efficient to schedule groups than individual students)programsemesterenrolled_courses (Array of course_ids - Major, Minor, etc.)Roomsroom_id (Primary Key)room_numbercapacitytype ('Lecture Hall', 'Lab')TimeSlotstimeslot_id (Primary Key)day_of_week ('Monday', 'Tuesday', ...)start_timeend_timeTimetable (The final output)entry_id (Primary Key)course_id (Foreign Key)faculty_id (Foreign Key)group_id (Foreign Key)room_id (Foreign Key)timeslot_id (Foreign Key)semester
